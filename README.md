# Total-Recall

Total-Recall is a memory-based game that challenges players to remember and replicate sequences of patterns. The game offers two engaging modes to test your memory and focus:

Patterns Game: In this mode, players must follow a sequence of visual patterns that increase in length with each level. As the sequence grows, the player must correctly identify and replicate the entire pattern to progress to the next level. Each correct sequence earns a point, and the game continues until a mistake is made, leading to a "Game Over" screen.

Pattern Unlock Game: Inspired by the pattern unlocking mechanism found on mobile phones, this mode presents players with a 3x3 grid of dots. A sequence of connected dots is shown, and the player must replicate the exact pattern by connecting the dots in the correct order. As the levels increase, the sequences become more complex. A mistake results in the game ending with a "Game Over" message.
